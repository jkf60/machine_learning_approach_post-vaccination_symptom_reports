'Analysis of Pediatric Post-Vaccination Symptom Reports: An Unsupervised Learning Approach Final Progress Report'

Abstract: 

This capstone report presents the results of a comprehensive analysis of pediatric adverse events following immunization (AEFI) using data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) years 2017 to 2023. Investigation of pediatric symptom reports for children aged from birth to 21 years using market basket analysis revealed several noteworthy associations differentiated by pediatric age group and vaccine type. Local site reaction symptom associations proved to be common and frequent among all age groups and vaccine types. Symptom association results were analogous with Brighton Collaboration case definitions for AEFI conditions. Neonatal and infant AEFI symptom reports after receiving Hepatitis B vaccination corresponded to the clinical manifestations for Hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes (HHE). COVID-19 and booster association findings correspond to known signs and symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Found AEFI symptom associations in children narrate possible adverse event progression and offer valuable information to educate clinical decision-making and public health vaccine safety surveillance.
